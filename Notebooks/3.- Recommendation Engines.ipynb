    "\n",
    "The recommendation engine provides product type-based recommendations when no product-level association is found. Here's a brief summary of the recommendations for the product \"buttertarts\" based on its product type \"pastry\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pastry → Cookies**: \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 2.49\n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 37.44%\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Customers who purchase pastries are 2.49 times more likely to also purchase cookies compared to random chance. This suggests that offering cookies alongside pastries could enhance cross-selling opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pastry → Savoury Items**: \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 1.88\n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 27.25%\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: There is a moderate association between pastries and savory items, indicating that customers may prefer to balance sweet and savory flavors in their orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pastry → Bread**: \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 1.64\n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 21.09%\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Bread is another item that customers frequently purchase with pastries. This association could be leveraged for meal deals or breakfast promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pastry → Pie**: \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 1.44\n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 25.59%\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: There is a significant likelihood that customers who buy pastries also purchase pies, highlighting an opportunity to promote these items together, especially during seasonal events.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pastry → Cakes**: \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 0.33\n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 15.88%\n",
    "   - **Analysis**: While the association is weaker, there is still a notable connection between pastries and cakes. This could be a strategic pairing for upselling during special occasions or events.\n",
    "\n",
    "This output demonstrates that when a direct product-level association is not available, the recommendation engine successfully falls back on product type-level associations, offering relevant suggestions that can help increase sales through cross-promotion."
